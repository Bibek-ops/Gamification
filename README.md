Gamification In E-learning
For my final year thesis, I focused on gamification in e-learning, exploring how game design elements can enhance educational experiences. As part of this project, I developed a website that implements a point system to reward users upon completing courses. This system aims to increase engagement and motivation in e-learning environments by integrating game-like incentives.
